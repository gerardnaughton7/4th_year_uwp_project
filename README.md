# 4th_year_uwp_project

## Project Overview

For our 4th year Mobile Applications project we were set guidlines from our lecturer Damian Costello as follows:

Create a Windows 10 UWP App. The application should incorporate the following elements:

* A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.

* A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose. User Experience should be carefully considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent
across devices.

* Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written
in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.

* Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach.

## My Project

I created a Windows 10 UWP app using Azure as my Mysql database service. I wrote my code using visual studio and configured my back end with my Azure Portal.

## What does my App do?

I created a Galway Pub Review App. The App allows the user to view Galway pub reviews, Search a list of reviews by pub, create a review in a step by step guide and post their review to our database.

The App consists of 5 pages which are framed around a nav-bar and image on the right hand side.

The page includes:

1. PubsReviewPage: Displays the list of pub reviews and allows to search by pub.

2. SelectPubPage: This is Step 1 of making a review where you can select a list of pubs you want to review

3. RatinsPage: Is the next step of making a review and allows the user to rate the pub on Beverage, atmosphere and craic out of 10.

4. YourReviewPage: This is the final page, the user will enter there name/nickname and personal review and will submit all the review to the database.
